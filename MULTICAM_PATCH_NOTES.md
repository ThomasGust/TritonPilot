# Multi-cam Warm Mode Patch Notes\n\n- Keeps all tabbed camera streams alive concurrently (staggered warm-up).\n- Preserves tab UI while making switching effectively instant.\n- Serializes ROV VideoRPC calls on the topside client to avoid REQ/REP conflicts\n  when multiple widgets reconnect in parallel.\n- Serializes RemoteCameraManager open/close bookkeeping.\n- Example `data/streams.json` updated to 1920x1080 native H.264 (`video-index2`).\n
